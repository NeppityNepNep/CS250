The Gaming Room and the Client Draw it or Lose it is a game that is multi-platform and is web-based. They wanted us to create a server where the players can connect to with their details. The server handles each instance in a game with security via username and password. I think comparing the operating systems for their specific use-case came naturally to me and I did particually well on. The process of working on the design doc gave asome guidelines on how to develop the code and what the code needed to be to fit the usecase. If I were to change soemthing, I would have picked the requirements to be a little more specific, though they were still pretty good. The user's needs are at the forefront of software design as they need to be able to use it. Their needs become the basis of features of the game. I appraoched it with a goal in mind, by making a list of things that needed to be done, and being able to go back and fix parts is important. The agile method I think is the best way by modularizing your work and making it editable, rather than linear and unchanging.
